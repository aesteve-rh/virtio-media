/// Trait allowing sessions of a device to signal when they have an event pending.
///
/// The worker that runs a `V4l2ProxyDevice` typically polls on file descriptors for available
/// CAPTURE buffers and outstanding session events. However V4L2's poll logic returns with the
/// `POLLERR` flag if a CAPTURE queue is polled while not streaming or if zero CAPTURE buffers have
/// been queued. To avoid this, the device needs to disable polling when this would happen, and
/// re-enable it when conditions are adequate.
///
/// If the worker does not need such a feature, `()` can be passed as a no-op type that implements
/// this interface.
pub trait SessionPoller: Clone {
    /// Add a newly created `session` to be polled.
    ///
    /// The `session` FD must signal that it is readable if there are events pending for the
    /// session.
